Those are some of my scripts I use on my linux and cygwin machines. If you want take a look.

To install them on your system I made a oh-my-zsh like installer. To execute it put the next line in the shell.

```script
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Poeschl/pscripts/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

or

```script
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Poeschl/pscripts/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Hint:
The scripts are executed by the zsh shell. So if a script is broken because of that I'm happy to receive a RP.
