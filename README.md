This are my installation scripts for fresh linux arch systems. They install my basic needs and development environments.

### Important:

* You need to give the root partition more then 10 GiB. The android-sdk is filling your system otherwise.

### How to get it:

To get them and execute them via the github link use:

For arch_raw_setup
```shell
sh -c "$(wget -O - https://git.io/vPzYQ)"
```

For arch_tools_setup
```shell
sh -c "$(wget -O - https://git.io/vPzYA)"
```

Remember to have a working internet connection and wget installed.
