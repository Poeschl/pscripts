This are my installation scripts for fresh linux arch systems. They install my basic needs and development environments.

### Important:

* A working internet connection is needed.
* You need to give the root partition at least 8 GiB for proper space.

### How to get it:

To get them and execute them via the github link use (`wget` needs to be installed):

For arch_raw_setup
```shell
sh -c "$(wget -O - https://git.io/vPzYQ)"
```

For arch_tools_setup
```shell
sh -c "$(wget -O - https://git.io/vPzYA)"
```
